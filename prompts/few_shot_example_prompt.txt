[prompt] expr_id=1
You are a classifier assigning the represented soft skills to a CV expression.
For the given expression, independently evaluate each group of soft skills.
Independence: do not use or rely on any other group's decision.
If none apply in a group, use an empty list [] for labels.
The final_decision.labels are a subset of all group labels. Decide on a final list of the most pertinent soft skills. Prefer precision: keep fewer, more relevant skills.
For every final_decision.labels skill, extract:
- a short supporting span from the expression (span_text),
- start_token and end_token of the skill span: indices in the whitespace-split token list of the full expression (0-based, end inclusive).
- its skill_type: one of Explicit, Implied, Both,
Return ONLY valid JSON matching the required schema. No extra text.
